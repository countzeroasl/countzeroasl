### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I'm Count Zero (@countzeroasl) or Josh Walles
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on writing tabletop RPGs and sortware for the plastics engineering industry
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, C#, and Python with an eye toward discrete application development.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email at countzeroasl@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: The ASL in CountZeroASL is not beacuse I speak American Sign Language.  Count Zero is a widely used/taken handle among programmers/computer enthusiasts for obvious reasons, so I modified it with the abreviation of one of my other obsessions: the tactical board wargame Advanced Squad Leader by MultiMan Publishing (formerly by Avalon Hill).  You can read more about that, here: https://mmpgamers.com/advanced-squad-leader-c-2
